# üë®üèΩ About Me
Hello there! I go by the name **Divine-Wisdom O. Adewumi** and I'm a Biomedical Laboratory Scientist turned Data Analyst on account of my penchant for seeking and finding patterns in data all around us. Insights from data in healthcare, business, education, music and geopolitics tend to pique my interest the most.
